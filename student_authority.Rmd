.larger[Why is student authority important?]

--

Learning in classrooms goes beyond understanding new concepts. 

--

Students also learn who they are and what they can and cannot do. 

<!-- Students’ identities are “dynamically negotiated,” representing a synthesis of -->
<!-- who they are and who they have learned to be through interactions with others.  -->

--

These identities / beliefs largely determine what students' participation in the
classroom looks like.
